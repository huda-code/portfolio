Faced on 8.17 acres of land facing Yeouido Park, and scheduled to completition in 2013, this mixed-use complex will be comprised of three office towers, a five-star hotel, a retail mall, fine dining and considerable new outdoor public spaces. The project aspires to become a defining landmark of Korea and help in the revitalization of the island, that houses also the headquarters of many Korean financial institutions and the National Assembly. To experience this project, represented the opportunity to be exposed to an international team and a superb team cross-functional design experience.",

In this sense the particular uses for a live-study facility at the significantly expansive MIT campus was understood as a plastic malleable component that allowed the formulation of new programmatic conditions. The idea of the structure holding this program was explored through the use of various laser cutter techniques. A section analysis study helped to redefine the morphology of the project and reformulate the new programmatic conditions. This exercise attempted to address the issue of plasma as a constructive/concept generator material. Being the prevailing state of matter, the so called fourth state is abundantly present throughout the known universe. Plasma is an exception in planet Earth, but have different manifestations for example in Aurora Borealis (Northern Light), fire, flourescent lights, Tokmaks, etc. Using these initial ideas about plasma, PMC-121 rubber was selected as a similar-in-performance and more manageable material for experimentation. The rubber was manipulated and tested in performance and structural capabilities through diffe- rent casting experimentations.",

Located in the middle of a plantain field, it required accommodation for 3,000 sqft for a young family. From its inception it approaches issues of identity and sustainability. The house was strategically located on top of the highest point on the property to take advantage the winds, the solar gains and the spectacular views. Due to the lack of proper water and power infrastructure, water and solar collection was a fundamental element on the design. A tunnel intended to passive-cool the house was located in between the concrete slab, with the intention that it would control the wind using the fluid dynamics ‘Bernoulli’ principle. The distinctive leaf of the surrounding musa paradisiaca trees (plantain) was used as reference for the proposed envelope for the house. Platain is the backbone of the diet and identity of the culture where this project is located. ",

After dedicating some time examining the history of the stadium typology up to recent developments on this typology, a ‘borderless’ urban approach was suggested. This ‘borderless’ condition intended both to erase the Hudson River frontier to the west and the significant urban barrier that is 11th Avenue to create a plug-and-play strategy in which the stadium became the most important magnet. The notion of a contained stadium was disrupted with a sport facility that would integrate the surrounding urban parks, water venues and pedestrian corridors conforming the bigger urban strategy into the stadium field itself. The concept of “urban tailgating” is the best evidence of this strategy. ",

A grand scale composite painting by the American painter Robert Rauschenberg was analyzed and used as a conceptual guide. This painting, by the use of paint strokes, color and “found objects”, reflects the “memory” of the author’s first walk through the streets of Manhattan. The sequence of this walk was reconstructed using various two and three dimensional methods that eventually helped to define the spatial experience for the project. This methodology was translated eventually to the specifics of the site and the definition of the program. The result was a “museum of alternate histories” that merged into its Battery Park location, between the historics Castle Clinton and Pier A.",
